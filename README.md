# Overview 
  
The overview of this project was to clean/inspect the data given to me and manipulate it to pull insights from the information.
Using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook I was able to determine trends and correlations between student performance and the budget and resources allocated. Also see how school size plays a factor into performance if any. Any through removing data to keep the integrity of the data I was able to see what changes and impacts it caused the rest of the information. This data is useful for the school district it will be provided to. This will enable them to make decisions in the future by letting them see how past class size, spend per student impact testing, also and what classes need more attention placed to ensure student success.

## Summary 

By cleaning the data and removing the test scores of the 9th graders at Thomas High School there was not a significant change it the overall data. The overall passing score, reading score/percentages, math score/percentages of the district all moved by less than 1%. There was only a reduction of 461 students with the removal of the in-question scores. This is approximately 1.2% of the total population so the impacted change in the metrics matches up with what would be expected. Thomas High School did not change in their ranking as #@ in the district based on overall passing score percentage either.
